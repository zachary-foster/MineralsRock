# Minerals Rock

A complete overhaul of mountainous terrain and rocks in RimWorld, adapted to vanilla from the Hardcore SK mod by the original author.
Rocks now come in different sizes, textures, and shapes other than square (gasp!).
Different types of rocks have distinct appearances and properties that affect gameplay, so each map looks and feels different.
Rock types vary more in how hard they are to mine, how much they yield when mined, how rocky the landscape is, how beautiful they are, and how much cover they provide in a gunfight.
Want an easy to mine map with lots of building material? Go for sandstone.
Want the ultimate mountain fortress and are prepared to work for it? Go for granite.
This mod aims to make the rock type and terrain more strategic choices.
Also, check the settings for options to tweak the rock properties to your liking, including setting the number of rock types per map!

## Rock properties

### Sandstone

-   Hit points / time to mine: very low
-   Chunk drop rate: **highest**
-   Landscape: few rocks and little cover
-   Beauty: very high

Sandstone is a soft sedimentary rock, so is quite easy to work with and mine.
Since sandstone erodes faster than other rocks, sandstone landscapes tend to be less rocky overall and provide less cover.

### Slate

-   Hit points / time to mine: low
-   Chunk drop rate: medium
-   Landscape: not rocky and little cover
-   Beauty: medium

Slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock formed from compacted volcanic ash or silt.
It forms in regular layers that are rectangular enough to be used for buildings without stone cutting.

### Limestone

-   Hit points / time to mine: medium
-   Chunk drop rate: high
-   Landscape: somewhat rocky and some cover
-   Beauty: low

Limestone is a hard sedimentary rock.
Its uniformity and medium hardness makes limestone a good and abundant building material.

### Marble

-   Hit points / time to mine: high
-   Chunk drop rate: medium
-   Landscape: somewhat rocky and lots of cover
-   Beauty: high

Marble is a metamorphic rock of melted and recrystallized limestone.
It is often used in decorative applications but is also quite hard.

### Basalt

-   Hit points / time to mine: high
-   Chunk drop rate: low
-   Landscape: extremely rocky and some cover
-   Beauty: **lowest**

Basalt is the most common igneous rock and is often associated with recent volcanic activity.
Recent lava flows can make basalt landscapes variable, very rocky, and difficult to build on.
However, basalt landascapes are often contain obsidian deposits.

### Granite

-   Hit points / time to mine: **highest**
-   Chunk drop rate: **lowest**
-   Landscape: somewhat rocky and lots of cover
-   Beauty: medium

Granite is an igneous rock which cooled slowly deep underground, allowing for large crystals to form.
It is very strong, but difficult to quarry.

### Glacial Ice

-   Hit points / time to mine:**lowest**
-   Chunk drop rate: None 
-   Landscape: almost no cover
-   Beauty: **highest**

Did you know that ice is technically a mineral?
Well neither did I until I looked it up and found it convenient to include it here!
Glacial ice is very easy to mine, but yields no stone chunks.
It is also very beautiful, but provides almost no cover in a gunfight.

### Vacstone

-   Hit points / time to mine: high
-   Chunk drop rate: medium
-   Landscape: very rocky but little cover
-   Beauty: low

A pretty midddle-of-the-road rock type, vacstone is similar to basalt but IN SPACE!

## Rock sizes and shapes

Every type of rock comes in multiple forms, which vary in size, how they restrict movement, and how much cover they provide in a gunfight.

### Weathered rock walls

These replace the vanilla rock walls that are unroofed.
They have lower hit points than rocks under a mountain.

### Solid rock walls

These replace the vanilla rock walls that are under thin roofs or cave walls.

### Hewn rock walls

These replace the vanilla rock walls that are under thick rooks.
They are only seen when mining and have the blocky appearance of vanilla rocks.

### Boulders

Large rocks that can be climbed over, but cannot be stood on.
They provide very good cover.

### Scattered rocks

Low numerous rocks that slow movement a little.


## Compatibility

New rock types introduced by other mods are not automatically supported since each rock type has unique textures and properties, however they will not break the game.
It is relatively easy to add support for new rock types, so if you would like a particular rock type supported please let me know or even better make a pull request on GitHub!
I am not aware of any incompatibilities with other mods, but please let me know if you find any.
